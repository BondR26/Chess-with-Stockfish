# Chess-with-Stockfish
Chess game
Basically this is my first small commercial project that a did as a test for a company.
This is a chess game that i did with the help of two sources 
- stockfish.exe chess engine
- sfml library

Int e game itself you use up and down to move through menu. 
Enter to select menu item;
To escape from game you press Escape.

When checkmate happens you will see appropriate image.

By the way, 
there are a few adjacments you would have to make in order for this game to work;
Install and include SFML library and properly connect all the images and sounds used for the game.
